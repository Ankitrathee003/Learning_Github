# DETECTING A CYCLE  [Depth first sort]

# For every visited vertx "v", if there is an adjacent "u" such that u is already visited 
# and u is not parennt of v, then there isa cycle in graph


# Topological Sort:  It is for directed acyclic graph only

# Topological Sort  : Linear ordering of all its vertices such that if G contains an edge (u,v) then u appears before v.
# it is used in Job assigning like in PERT CPM
##  Topological Sort (it can be done using DFS and as well as BFS)

# Using DFS add nodes to the stack when ever coming back it is found to be vistited


## Strongly Connected componenets :  A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pair of vertices 

## Finding the path between two vertices


##  Check if graph is Biparite or Not
