# In heap sort also inserting and delete is having time Complexity O(nlog(n)) 
##  Sapce complexity of Heap sort is O(n)  storing n elements in Heap


### to save space we can implement inPlace heap sort
  ## Here first we have to insert elements one by one according to CBT and heap order properties
  ##  After inserting we will start removing elements from top same and put last element there as that we do in remove min
## As we are using Min Heap we will get the elements in Decreasing order for increasing order we have to reverse the array
