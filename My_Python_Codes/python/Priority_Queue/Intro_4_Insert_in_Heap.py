## Inserting In Heap ##

## In Case of Min heap when we want to insert any number insert at bottom according to the Complete Binary Tree property
## Than if number is smallerr than its parent than they that child and parent will be swaped and this swapping will continue until root of tree or parent is smallest

## insertion in Max Heap will also take place in same way here swapping will occur when root node is smaller
