## Here we are going to prortize the elements 
## for example if passengers are waiting than we will give seat to which passengers
### Here we can give the seat on Basis of different criterias TO PRIORTIZE
# 1. First come First Serve Basis
# 2. Based on VIP Factor
##3. In Hospital it may be Critical Condition Factor

### If we are giving highest priority to Smallest element than it is Ascending Priority Queue or MIN PRIORITY QUEUE
### If we are giving highest priority to GREATEST element than it is DESCEnding Priority Queue or MAX PRIORITY QUEUE


# Insert 
# Get max or get Min  (It does not mean that we are removing we are just getting) # But in queue class in python get() method also removes the element from queue
# Remove Max or Remove Min
